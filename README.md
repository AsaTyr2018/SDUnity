# SDUnity

This project is a prototype interface for Stable Diffusion built with Gradio.
It features a demo generator UI with prompt and negative prompt fields as well as
controls for seed, steps and resolution. The app can list models and LoRA files
from the `models/` and `loras/` folders and displays generated images in a
gallery.

## Available Models

Built-in presets are provided for several Hugging Face models. Any model files
placed in the `models/` folder (e.g. `.safetensors` or `.ckpt`) are also offered
in the selector.
